# wordle-cheat

Are you tired of being beat at the wordle game? Worry no more since now you can guess the words like a pro.

This python script tells you which words to guess next and it's always right.

Run it from the command line with python3 cheat.py. You have to have the wordlist named words.txt in the same directory as the python script

## Example usage
